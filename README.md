# Sync Reminder

This project introduces an application designed to resolve the issue of forgotten reminders by automatically generating events from messages in chat applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram. By employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the app interprets messages to determine dates, times, and contexts, ensuring reminders are set up precisely. It integrates with Google Calendar through OAuth for direct management of calendar events from messages. The application is deployed using a serverless architecture, leveraging Lambda functions activated by API Gateway.
